# Causal Course Notes

This repo contains the course notes I created in Fall 2023 for Stat 286 / Gov 2003 Causal Inference with Applications, taught by [Kosuke Imai](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/) and TAed by myself and another graduate student. Other materials for the course are available [here](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/teaching/cause.html). My hope is that these notes will be useful to students in future iterations of the course and perhaps beyond. 

You are free to download and reference these notes under the following conditions: 

 1. You contact me at kyla_chasalow@g.harvard.edu if you find mistakes, typos, or ambiguities so that I can fix them! I am happy to add an acknowledgement for any substantial corrections.
 2. You give proper attribution if referencing or quoting from these notes 

**Disclaimer:** these notes have not been peer reviewed and may contain errors. They also do not include every single sub-topic covered in Stat 286 / Gov 2003 and hence are not a full replacement for the videos, slides, and lecture.
